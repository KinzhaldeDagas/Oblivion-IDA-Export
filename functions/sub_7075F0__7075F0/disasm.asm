0x7075FA: call    NiAVObject_UpdatePropertiesAndControllers; Update one NiAVObject's property controllers and attached NiTimeController chain. If requested, walk the property list at NiAVObject+0x9C and invoke property virtual +0x50 when its controller pointer is non-null. Always walk NiObjectNET.controller at object+0x0C through NiTimeController.next at +0x34 and invoke controller virtual Update +0x54 with applicationTime. No Active-bit prefilter occurs here: NiTimeController.flags+0x08 bit 3 only affects time-cache logic inside the controller. External Crossbow consequence after this Oblivion decode: temporarily clearing the base Active bit inside an already-entered morph hook will not by itself stop the next scene traversal, but pointer discovery still cannot make a graph that is not traversed dispatch Update.
